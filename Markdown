Browser Limitations and Compatibility Issues

## About
Browsers let us use the internet, but they don’t all work the same way.
They might handle code, features, or security rules differently.
Developers need to make sure their apps work well on all browsers so users have a good experience.


## Real-World Example
Imagine visiting a website that doesn’t load correctly on your browser. For example:

- A button might not respond because the browser doesn’t support the latest JavaScript feature.
- A layout might break due to CSS properties unsupported by older browsers.
- A video might fail to play because the browser doesn’t support the required codec.
